## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical indicators such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure and ECG results. I used the following [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) to train my model. **Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb** contains both the source code as well as my thought process when writing it.

The goal was not just to achieve high accuracy, but also to understand which health factors contribute most to risk — reflecting real-world applications where interpretability matters as much as performance.


## Why This Project Matters

**Healthcare relevance** - Heart disease is the world's leading cause of death. Predictive models can help identify at-risk individuals early and support clinical decision-making.

**Employer relevance** - This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Translate complex datasets into actionable insights
- Build, tune and evaluate machine learning models
- Balance technical performance with interpretability and real-world usability


## What I Did

- **Data preprocessing:** Explored and cleaned data to handle missing values, scale features, and reduce the impact of anomalies
- **Exploratory analysis:** Analysed patterns in patient data (e.g., chest pain type, cholesterol levels and sex) through visualisations
- **Model training:** Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to provide accurate predictions in minimal time
- **Model optimisation:** Optimised model with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) to improve predictive accuracy
- **Results interpretation:** Translated results into natural language so stakeholders without technical expertise (e.g doctors) can understand them


## Next Steps

- Add XGBoost/LightGBM for boosted performance
- Develop a Streamlit dashboard for interactive predictions
- Use SHAP/LIME for deeper model explainability
- Incorporate feature engineering to improve model accuracy
